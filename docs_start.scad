  \anchor introduction

    [omdl] is an [OpenSCAD] mechanical design library that provides
    open-source high-level design primitives with coherent
    documentation generated by [Doxygen] using [openscad-amu].

    With Doxygen, the code documentation is written within the code
    itself, and is thus easy to keep current. Moreover, it provides a
    standard way to both write and present OpenSCAD design
    documentation, translatable to common output formats (html, pdf,
    etc). With [omdl], all library operations are \em parametric with
    minimal, mostly zero, global variable dependencies and all library
    API's include [markups] that describe its parameters, behavior, and
    use.

    [Validation] scripts are used to verify that the core operations
    work as expected across evolving [OpenSCAD] versions. This
    validation is performed when building and [installing] the library
    documentation). The library uses a common set of conventions for
    specifying [data types] and is divided into individual component
    modules of functionality, organized into groups, that may be
    included as desired.

  \section starting Getting Started

    \amu_define title         (Hello world)
    \amu_define image_views   (right top front diag)
    \amu_define image_size    (sxga)
    \amu_define image_columns (4)
    \amu_define scope_id      (quickstart)
    \amu_define notes_scad
      ( In this example, make_bearing_linear_rod() is used to construct
        a custom linear bearing for fabrication on a 3D-printer. )
    \amu_define notes_diagrams
      ( The dimension operations in the above example can be found near
        the end of ${FILE_NAME} within the \em scope \c ${scope_id}. )

    \amu_include (include/amu/scope_diagrams_3d.amu)

  \section contributing Contributing

    [omdl] uses [git] for development tracking, and is hosted on
    [GitHub] following the usual practice of [forking] and submitting
    [pull requests] to the source repository.

    As it is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public License],
    any file you change should bear your copyright notice alongside the
    original authors' copyright notices typically located at the top of
    each file.

    Ideas, requests, comments, contributions, and constructive
    criticism are welcome.

  \section support Support

    In case you have any questions or would like to make feature
    requests, you can contact the maintainer of the project or file an
    [issue].
