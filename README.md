Setup
-----

In order to use [omdl], it must be first be installed to an OpenSCAD
[library location] on your system. It can be copied manually, as
described in the OpenSCAD documentation, or can be installed via
[openscad-amu], the framework used to develop [omdl]. If [openscad-amu]
is used, the library documentation will be generated and added to an
index of [installed libraries] for convenient design reference.


Evaluation
----------

A setup script is available to build the development environment and
install the library to a temporary directory:

```bash
mkdir tmp && cd tmp
wget https://git.io/setup-omdl.bash
chmod +x setup-omdl.bash

./setup-omdl.bash --cache --branch-list tags1 --yes --install
```

The option `--yes` can be omitted if you prefer to confirm the
installation of each required package (see: `setup-omdl.bash --help`).
If you don't like shortened URLs, here is the full URL to
[setup-omdl.bash].

If all goes well, the library (and development framework) will have
been installed into a temporary directory named `cache`. Subsequently,
the omdl library documentation can be viewed by typing:

```bash
firefox cache/local/share/OpenSCAD/docs/html/index.html
```


Installing
----------

To install the latest tagged release of [omdl] to the OpenSCAD user
library path on your system, use these options:

```bash
./setup-omdl.bash --branch-list tags1 --no-excludes --yes --install
```

To install a specific [omdl] library version, for example v0.6.1, use:

```bash
./setup-omdl.bash --branch v0.6.1 --no-excludes --yes --install
```

Use library components in your OpenSCAD designs as expected, replacing
the version number as appropriate:

```bash
include <omdl-v0.6.1/omdl-base.scad>;
...
```

Manual Compilation
------------------

To make changes to [omdl] or rebuild it manually, make sure the
variables `AMU_LIB_PATH` and `AMU_TOOL_PREFIX` (trailing directory
slash required for the latter) are set to the *absolute paths* for your
installation of [openscad-amu] in the project `Makefile`. See
[installing openscad-amu] for more information.

To update project Makefile and build HTML documentation:

```bash
cd cache/omdl
make help
make info

make all
```

The output of 'make info' shows all of the boolean control variables
and configurable value variables that configure the build process.
